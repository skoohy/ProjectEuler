# ProjectEuler
These are my solutions to project euler problem. They are by no means the fastest method but they get the job done.
I dont claim that all of these solution are 100% original, some of them are, and some are found through research/hints/help, I try to provide the link 
to solutions I use that are not mine. Some are very brute force and some use more dynamic programming or more sophisticate algorithmic approaches.
I hope in the future to imporve the quality of notebooks and the solution methods used for the code files.
