    "Lets figure out the base case. The problem gives us that $1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4$, consider a number $n$. We can check this by writing $n$'s digits out, and seeing if the sum of all the digits raised to the fourth power is equal to $n$. Essentially, if $n_1,...,n_i$ represent the digitis of a number of length $i$ then, for a four digit number, we want $n_1n_2n_3n_4 = n_1^4 + n_2^4 + n_3^4 + n_4^4$. In our case $n_1 = 1$, $n_2 = 5$, $n_3 = 3$, and $n_4 = 4$. Consider the following block of code to find the digits for $n = 1634$."
